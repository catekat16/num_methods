    "While traditional animation has required artists to draw animations frame by frame manually, more modern animation techniques developed for procedure animation have enabled the physics of character movement in games to be more realistic. The topic of inverse kinematics poses the question of what angles a set of joints should be set for a robotic arm in order to reach the desired point. There are many different numerical algorithms that have been explored within this topic, including:\n",

Currently, I'm leaning towards using newton's method, cyclic coordinate descent, gradient descent for the scope of this project implementation. \n",
